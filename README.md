## Overview

**Cueboard** is a minimal, open-source CRM designed for small, focused teams. It strips away the bloat of traditional CRMs and provides a clear, actionable dashboard to manage client relationships proactively. With a shared interaction timeline, a smart priority queue, and tools for meeting prep, Cueboard ensures your team always knows who to contact next and why.

## Key Features

### Core CRM Functionality

- **Client Management** - Full CRUD for your client portfolio, including contact details, ownership, and website URLs
- **Interaction Logging** - A central, user-attributed timeline for every call, email, and meeting
- **Flexible Tagging** - Organize and filter clients with a custom, creatable tagging system
- **Secure Multi-Tenancy** - A company-first registration system with unique invite codes ensures your team's data is completely private

### Proactive Outreach

- **Priority Queue** - Automatically surfaces clients that are overdue for contact, sorted by priority
- **Custom Contact Cadence** - Set a unique follow-up frequency (e.g., every 7, 30, or 90 days) for each client
- **Meeting Prep** - A dedicated scratchpad to jot down discussion points for any client on demand, accessible right before a call

### Comfortable UI/UX

- **Unified Layout** - A clean AppShell provides a consistent header and experience across the application
- **Light & Dark Modes** - Switch between themes for your viewing comfort
- **Modern Design** - A polished interface built with Mantine that moves beyond basic HTML tables to a more intuitive card-based layout
